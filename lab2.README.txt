I created an x&y variable that increased or decreased each time the corresponding button is pressed. 
I also created a vector that held the colors as well as the position of the shapesâ€™ vertices. 
The x&y variables range between -10 and 10, and then are multiplied by .1 and added to the 
original position of the vectors.
